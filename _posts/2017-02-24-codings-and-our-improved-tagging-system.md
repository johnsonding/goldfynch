**We’ve created a new category of ‘tags’ called ‘codings’**

- A coding is a special tag that is pinned/unpinned (i.e. toggled on/off) by clicking its button. 

- When unpinned (i.e. turned off), the coding’s button changes color, but remains visible.  

- In contrast, with regular tags the button disappears when deactivated.  

_Here, the first 4 buttons are codings the last green one is a regular tag. The coding outlined with a red box is ‘unpinned’._

[**Note:** GoldFynch has had a ‘codings’ system for a while, but only for fixed categories. Our rebooted version is much more versatile.] 

**You can apply codings as quickly as tags. **

They’re in the tag pane, with one-click access.

**You can convert a tag into a coding, and a coding into a tag.**

**In file listings, the coding tags appear before regular tags.**

_Below, the first 4 tags are codings:_

**You can unpin codings and remove tags in bulk.**

**If you delete a tag from the ‘Tags’ section, GoldFynch asks for confirmation and shows you how many files may be affected.**

**We have also created ‘auto tags’. **

They are managed by GoldFynch, so you cannot add/remove/edit them. 

_E.g. The ‘Untagged’ tag for items that don’t have any other tags._


### We’ve created a new category of ‘tags’ called ‘codings’
A coding is a special tag that is pinned/unpinned (i.e. toggled on/off) by clicking its button. 
When unpinned (i.e. turned off), the coding’s button changes color, but remains visible.  
In contrast, with regular tags the button disappears when deactivated.  


We’re finished our switch over to Google Cloud Storage this weekend. You might have noticed some service interruptions this weekend.

### Why the switch?
Along with the benefits of added performance while uploading, downloading and processing your files, Google Cloud Storage provides us with extensive security and auditing capabilities. This a major milestone towards HIPAA complaint GoldFynch.

If you have any questions feel free to email us at support@goldfynch.com

### Interested in cloud providers comparison?
This article on Medium does an excellent job summarizing the differences between the various cloud providers.

Remember, Google Cloud is the infrastructure that Google leases to companies like us, not to be confused with Google Drive (which is a consumer product as a part of Google accounts). Google Cloud allows us to seamlessly and cost-effectively deliver services to our customers. With Google Cloud, we can utilize multi-region data centers, faster processors and advanced encryption. So your data is processed more quickly and stored more securely.
