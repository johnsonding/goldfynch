### We’ve created a new category of ‘tags’ called ‘codings’

- A coding is a special tag that is pinned/unpinned (i.e. toggled on/off) by clicking its button. 

- When unpinned (i.e. turned off), the coding’s button changes color, but remains visible.  

- In contrast, with regular tags the button disappears when deactivated.  

_Here, the first 4 buttons are codings the last green one is a regular tag. The coding outlined with a red box is ‘unpinned’._

[**Note:** GoldFynch has had a ‘codings’ system for a while, but only for fixed categories. Our rebooted version is much more versatile.] 

### You can apply codings as quickly as tags.

They’re in the tag pane, with one-click access.

### You can convert a tag into a coding, and a coding into a tag.

**In file listings, the coding tags appear before regular tags.**

_Below, the first 4 tags are codings:_

### You can unpin codings and remove tags in bulk.

**If you delete a tag from the ‘Tags’ section, GoldFynch asks for confirmation and shows you how many files may be affected.**

### We have also created ‘auto tags’.

They are managed by GoldFynch, so you cannot add/remove/edit them. 

_E.g. The ‘Untagged’ tag for items that don’t have any other tags._
