## Need to share a finished ‘production’ with a colleague? Do it via GoldFynch. 
When you finish working on a case and produce it, GoldFynch creates a zip file of that production. And now it’s super easy to share this file, right from the GoldFynch interface. No need to waste time downloading and emailing it.   

## It’s fast, easy, and secure.
GoldFynch tells your recipient that you’ve shared a production, and she can choose to download the zip file or open it as a new case within GoldFynch. Either way, you’ll get an update when she does it.  

## Here’s how to share productions in GoldFynch:
**Step 1: Click the** ***Production*** **tab in the left navigation pane.** Then click the *Share* button next to the production you want to share.

## Shared a production with the wrong person? 
**Click the ‘revoke’ button on the right of the email address.** 
Her link becomes invalid, and she won’t be able to download the production file.
