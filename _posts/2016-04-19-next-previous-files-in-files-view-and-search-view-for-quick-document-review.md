Documents can be reviewed quickly by clicking "Next Document" or "Previous Document" while in _Doc View_. You can easily navigate between subsequent or previous documents within a folder or when paging through search results.


When reading a document in _Files_, clicking "Previous Document" or "Next Document" right above the document will move through all files within a particular folder. Sort by name, date, or another category first to quickly page through related files within a folder, as shown below.

Navigate through search results using "Previous Document" or "Next Document." All files meeting the search criteria will be traversed in the Sort Order (relevance, ascending date, or descending date) specified.
