If you're worried about uploading a file that's already in your case in GoldFynch, have no fear: Exact Duplicate Detection is here.

Regardless of where the file is in your case, if you try to upload the same file more than once GoldFynch will give you a warning.

For now, this feature works best when you try to upload a file thats already in GoldFynch. We are working on other duplicate detection systems to scan for duplicate files that might have been within zip files as well as intelligent duplicate detection that scans the content of files. Eventually our smart duplicate algorithms will be able to detect files that are not just exact duplicates but close matches as well.
