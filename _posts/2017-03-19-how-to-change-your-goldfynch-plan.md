Choose from 4 paid plans: Egg (3 GB), Nestling (15 GB), Fledgling (50 GB), and (new)BigBird (100 GB); it’s easy to move from one to the other.

### Reasons to upgrade your plan

 - You’ve reached your plan’s storage limit.
 - You need faster processing. (The higher the plan, the faster the processing.)
 

### Reasons to downgrade your plan

- You don’t need all the storage your plan provides.
- You don’t need faster processing anymore.
 

Billing is prorated, so pay only for time on a plan till the upgrade/downgrade.  

### How to change your GoldFynch case plan

Changing plans is quick and easy.

 1. Select the case for which you want to upgrade or downgrade the plan.
 2. Click the ‘Settings’ button in the left menu. GoldFynch allows plan changing based on usage
 3. Click the ‘Change Case Plan’ tab.
 4. Click on the plan you want. Don’t worry, GoldFynch only displays valid options for selection and you can always upgrade or downgrade later.
