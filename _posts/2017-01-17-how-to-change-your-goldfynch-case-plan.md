### GoldFynch is flexible! Upgrade or downgrade your case plan as needed.

**Choose from 4 paid plans:** Egg (3 GB), Nestling (15 GB), Fledgling (50 GB), and **(new)**BigBird (100 GB); it’s easy to move from one to the other.

**Reasons to upgrade **your plan

- You’ve reached your plan’s storage limit.
- You need faster processing. (The higher the plan, the faster the processing.)

**Reasons to downgrade **your plan

- You don’t need all the storage your plan provides.
- You don’t need faster processing anymore.

**Billing is prorated**, so pay only for time on a plan till the upgrade/downgrade.
