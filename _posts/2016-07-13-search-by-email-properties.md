Trying to find all emails to do with a particular series of meetings? Or those to/from a specific person? Goldfynch lets you search for them using the ‘subject’, ‘to’, ‘cc’ or ‘bcc’ email fields.

Here’s how:

### Using the ‘from’ filter

1. **Search for emails from a particular email address**

2. **Search for emails from a particular person**

### Using the “subject” filter:

### Using the “cc” filter:

#### Tip: Goldfynch lets you use partial names or subjects when searching:

- When searching for a name (in “from”, “to”, “cc”, or “bcc”), both partial and full names will work (e.g. “to: Jon Smith” or “to: jon”).
- When searching for email subjects, part of a subject will work (e.g. “subject: meeting today” or “subject: today”).
