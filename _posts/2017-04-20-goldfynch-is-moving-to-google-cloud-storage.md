Weâ€™re finished our switch over to Google Cloud Storage this weekend. You might have noticed some service interruptions this weekend.

### Why the switch?
Along with the benefits of added performance while uploading, downloading and processing your files, Google Cloud Storage provides us with extensive security and auditing capabilities. This a major milestone towards HIPAA complaint GoldFynch.

If you have any questions feel free to email us at support@goldfynch.com

Remember, Google Cloud is the infrastructure that Google leases to companies like us, not to be confused with Google Drive (which is a consumer product as a part of Google accounts). Google Cloud allows us to seamlessly and cost-effectively deliver services to our customers. With Google Cloud, we can utilize multi-region data centers, faster processors and advanced encryption. So your data is processed more quickly and stored more securely.
