Google is awesome at search.  
GoldFynch is awesome at search.

Google searches the entire Internet.  
GoldFynch searches a finite amount of documents. Your documents, to be specific.

While it doesn't really make much sense to compare Google directly to GoldFynch, it does, however, make sense to compare the search experience.

Before Google, Internet search was a chore. It was slow and difficult to find what you were looking for. You had to get creative with your search terms and use complex search queries to get what you wanted.

Enter: Google.  
All of a sudden, you can use simple English to find what you want.  
It made the entirety of the internet into something everyone could easily access.  
Google's complex search algorithm makes this possible by ranking pages and returning results fast. It's so smart, you rarely ever need to go beyond page two.

The downside is that it eliminates results by ranking them lower and placing them on pages the user would never reach.

Unlike the average Google user looking up the lyrics to that song that's stuck in their head or the nearest gas station, GoldFynch users can't afford to eliminate results.

You need to be able to see all the results.  
To make this possible in an interface that wouldn't completely overwhelm users with information overload, we introduced a search within your search results feature.

Now when you search in GoldFynch, by default, you're searching within the first set of results returned.  
To manipulate your results you can click the "x" next to each search term to eliminate it from the results and create different combinations of search terms.

You can also search exclusively within a folder, by navigating into that folder.

While we understand the [temptation to compare Google to every other search experience you'll ever have](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-brainwash-why-we-think-need-faster-horse-anith-mathai) (it is a pretty universal tool), a key difference between Google and GoldFynch is that they were designed for very different purposes. As previously stated, Google was created to search the whole of the internet, while GoldFynch is meant only to search through the files you've uploaded to your case. So, while Google is a universal tool, that's precisely what makes the Google approach inappropriate for the type of search required by an e-Discovery tool.

A better comparison would be to the product [Google Scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar), a search tool created for academia to search research papers.
