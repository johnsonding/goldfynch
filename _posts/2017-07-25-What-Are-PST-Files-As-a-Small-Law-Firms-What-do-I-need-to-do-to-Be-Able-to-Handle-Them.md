## What is a PST file?

A *.pst* (*Personal Storage Table*) file is a special file type created by *Microsoft* for their *Outlook* email app. When you use *Outlook*, it stores all your emails, attachments, calendar events, etc. in a *.pst* file. So, think of it as more like a folder. (In fact, Microsoft calls them *personal folders*). 

[Note: Don’t confuse *Microsoft Outlook* with *Microsoft Outlook Express*. *Outlook Express* is a simpler version of *Outlook* and uses *.dbx* files instead of *.pst* files. These *.dbx* files aren’t encrypted, and messages are stored as plain text. With *.pst* files, messages are compressed and stored in a database.]  

## Back in the mid-‘90s, PSTs were a brilliant innovation. 

Storage space cost much more than it does now. So, email providers would cap the amount of data (i.e. emails and attachments) you could store on their servers. By using PSTs, you could take your data off their servers and onto your computer. This solved the ‘space’ problem. But a bonus was that your emails would be available offline. That was a big deal because dial-up connections back then were unreliable. With PSTs, you could connect to the internet, download your emails, and read them whenever. 

## But PST files have their problems. 

They were a brilliant innovation at the time. But as computers and the internet evolved, businesses evolved with them. And PSTs have become a liability. 

**First off, PSTs are easily corrupted,** because of some design flaws. For example, you can theoretically use PST files over a network. But doing it often ruins them because they weren’t designed to be accessed by more than one user at a time. And if the ruined file isn’t backed up (and it usually isn’t), you lose all your archived emails. 

**Secondly, PSTs were meant to be used only on one device.** So, if you use your laptop’s *Outlook* to store emails, those emails can only be accessed on that laptop. You can’t access them from your smartphone, on the go. Besides, your smartphone can’t read PSTs anyway, since they only work with *Outlook*.     
  
**Finally, PSTs complicate ediscovery.** *Microsoft Exchange* (*Microsoft’s* collaborative email tool that complements *Outlook*) doesn’t read PST files. So, you don’t get a ‘complete’ search when you use its ediscovery tools. Another complication is that PST files can inadvertently ‘hide’ emails. Many organizations purge old emails to prevent them from being subpoenaed for litigation. But if those emails are on a PST file, they can often be forgotten. 

## So, how should small law firms handle PSTs for ediscovery? 

What most of us would do is to open the PST with *Outlook.* What’s the big deal, right? Well, here are the problems:

1. **You’ll contaminate the file:** *Outlook* changes PST files when it uses them. So, your ‘evidence’ loses its electronic fingerprint (i.e. metadata). Things like when it was created, last modified, and last accessed.    
2. **You’ll waste a lot of time.** *Outlook* is slow, and it can’t search email attachments. Also, it’s designed to be used by only one person at a time. When you sign in under one profile, you can’t search through emails belonging to another profile. So, if you’re reviewing multiple accounts, each with a different PST file, you’ll have to sign in to one account, search, then sign out. And repeat the process with the next account. This is far from ideal.  
3. **You can’t do the real work of ediscovery** because *Outlook* doesn’t let you tag, redact, and ‘produce’ emails. 

## If not *Outlook,* then what? 

There are many apps out there that handle email ediscovery. The problem is most of them are complicated to use or don’t have the features you need. For example, *Google Desktop* can help you search files, emails, and attachments. But its search options are limited. *Microsoft Exchange Server* can handle basic ediscovery. But it’s not designed to work with PST files. *DtSearch Desktop* has a powerful search feature. But it uses command line syntax. Which means you need a background in something like MS-DOS.
