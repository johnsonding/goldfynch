### Are password-protected files slowing you down?

Large cases often have many password-protected files. And manually entering those passwords for each use is a waste of your time.

### GoldFynch has an elegant solution.

Use our _password list_ to enter all your passwords (you can copy-paste them in bulk) and GoldFynch will automatically find and use the right one when you need it.  Get the security you want, but without the hassle.

### Here’s how to use our password list:

1.**Choose the ‘files’ tab to view all your uploaded files**. The password-protected ones have a little lock symbol next to them.

2.**Click on a password-protected file.** The ‘password list’ will open.

3.**Enter the file’s password** **and save it.** You can copy-paste a list of passwords too: A new line for each password.

4.**Now the protected file will open automatically** when you click it.
