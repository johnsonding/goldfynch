That's it. You're done.** **


### Here are some FAQs:

**&gt;&gt; How do I confirm that my payment has been made?**

Check your billing page's 'account activity list' (i.e. from Step 2 above). The payment activity line for that month will change to "paid", as shown below:

**&gt;&gt; How do I download my invoice? Or see my billing details?**

- To download your invoice click the 'download' icon in your 'account activity list' (i.e. from Step 2 above).
- To see billing details, click the 'down arrow' in your 'account activity list' (i.e. from Step 2 above).

**&gt;&gt; How do I pay for individual cases?**

You don't need to pay for individual cases. Billing is linked to your account as a whole, so your payment is made for all the cases in your account.
