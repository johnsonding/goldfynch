*Perfect for small law firms: Get flexible ediscovery and still know exactly how much you’ll be paying every month.* 

We’ve noticed that you need a wider range of case plans
-------------------------------------------------------

For example, we’ve found that most small cases use less than 1 GB of space. But our old Legacy Egg Plan started at 3GB,  for $15 per month. 

So, now we’re filling in the gaps
---------------------------------

If 1 GB is all you need, our new 1 GB plan will help you spend 30% less every month.  Our older plans used to jump from 10 GB to 50 GB. If you had a 12 GB case, you would still be paying for 50 GB. Now we have 15 and 25 GB cases to fill in the gaps.

[Take a look at our pricing options.](https://goldfynch.com/pricing)

We offer fixed plans, so you know exactly how much you’ll be paying every month
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many ediscovery providers offer a ‘per GB’ pricing system. When you add files, you pay for a few GBs more. When you delete files, you pay for a few GBs less. This seems smart at first. But if you keep paying for small shifts in case size, you’ll never know for sure how much you’ll be paying the next month. 

Plus our competition prices are not pro-rated. Which means you have to pay for the whole month. An added layer of complexity. How do you calculate your monthly usage? Is it the average amount of data uploaded? the highest amount of data?   This isn’t ideal for a small law firm. It gets even more complicated because often times you are obligated to bill your clients ethically, so you need to calculate the billing correctly.

We set case sizes, so you know up-front how much you’ll be paying. But we prorate the prices. So, you pay only for the amount of time you spend on a particular plan, and this number is always available to you on the billing page (GoldFynch account required)/ You can switch plans mid-month (or at any other time)—or even quit GoldFynch—and pay only for time spent on that plan.  

Fixed plans also save you money
-------------------------------

Since we know exactly how much space you’ll be using, we can budget our resources better. Which allows us to negotiate better rates with our cloud providers. That’s why GoldFynch costs 1/10th the price of most other ediscovery services. 

Our new plan sizes offer the benefits of simple monthly billing, much lower costs and prorated price calculations.
