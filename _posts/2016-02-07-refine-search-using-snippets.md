You can now refine your search based on “snippets” of each result.

"Snippets" are brief excerpts of a file that show up below the search results. The purpose is to provide context for your results within each document.

When you select a file based on a “snippet”, GoldFynch opens that file and automatically navigates to the location of that particular “snippet” within the file.

As you can see in the example below, all other search results are also highlighted within the selected document.
