### Imagine walking into an office filled with paper. 
You see paper on the desk, paper in filing cabinets, paper on shelves. There’s a printer somewhere in all that and perhaps even a fax machine.  

### Now imagine walking into that same office, but without the paper. 
You see an elegant desk, chair, and computer. And without the clutter distracting you, you notice the nice paintings on the wall and the potted plant in the corner.

### Is going paperless just about have a better looking, minimal office? 
The office described above seems better the second time, obviously. But is there more to it than just looks? Yes. Here’s why going paperless really matters:  

#### It’s easy to keep your office organized
You’re converting paper documents into digital files. So, all the files that used to fill your office space now sit on a small PC or laptop. They’re easier to categorize, tag, number, and archive. And it’s easier to correct a misfiling. 

#### You can find files and information in seconds 
Instead of opening filing cabinets and leafing through folders you’ll be able to use your computer’s ‘search’ feature to find the files you want. And if you install [ediscovery software](https://goldfynch.com/), you can search through the actual content of all those files, regardless of whether they are PDFs, Word files, or emails. 

#### You won’t lose your documents, ever
Paper documents can be stolen. And moisture and fire destroy them. Digital documents can be put on the internet, backed up on multiple servers. So, you’ll never lose a document again. 

#### You can edit documents online, with you team
Apps like Google Docs let you store your documents on the internet and work on them together in real-time. So you and your team can edit contracts without actually being in the same room at the same time, or emailing drafts back and forth.

#### You can run your firm on the go 
You’ll learn to backup all your documents on the internet, so you can access them from the nearest PC, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone. Very useful for when you have to be in court but forgot to bring that important document. 

#### You’ll save money on printing
Working with paper means a lot of printing. And your printer will need constant maintenance.  You have to pay tech support to repair it, and you have to regularly buy ink and toner. 

#### You’ll do less damage to the environment
Less paper means less deforestation, which means less climate change. Plus less energy spent processing and transporting the paper. Which is especially good considering most of the time we are printing preliminary drafts to be edited and then reprinted, again and again.  

#### You’re sending an important message to your clients
You’re letting them know that you are up-to-date with business trends and are constantly in search of tools that help make you a better lawyer.   

### So, how do you go paperless?
You’ll need to get all your documents onto your computer and start to use computer apps instead of paper. Here’s how: 

#### Scan important documents to make them digital 
Use your smartphone to take photos of smaller items like slips, receipts, business cards, and bills you have to pay. It’s the same as scanning them, and you can transfer these photos to your computer. Use smartphone apps like [FileThis](https://filethis.com/) to help you organize scanned bills and remind you when they need to be paid. 

For larger documents, buy a scanner or use smartphone apps like TurboScan. These apps help your smartphone photograph documents better by detecting document edges, adjusting the contrast, etc. You can get [TurboScan for iPhones](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/turboscan-quickly-scan-multipage/id342548956?mt=8) and [TurboScan for Androids](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.piksoft.turboscan&hl=en).  

Use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert scanned documents into usable text. When you scan a document, the computer sees a picture of text, not actual text. OCR converts that picture into a PDF you can edit and search. There are many OCR apps, but you can use [GoldFynch’s](https://goldfynch.com/) free OCR to tackle scanning and ediscovery at the same time.   

For large batches of scanning, outsource the work to scanning services like [DocuFree](http://www.docufree.com/solutions/scanning-storage-retrieval/). They’ll pick up your documents, scan them, use OCR on them to convert them into editable PDFs, and bring the originals back to you (or shred them).  

#### Put all your files on the cloud
Now that all your files, receipts, and bills are digital, it’s time to put them on the ‘cloud’. The cloud is a network of thousands of high-end computers (more specifically, ‘servers’) connected to each other by the internet. When you put your files on the cloud, you are outsourcing storage to companies like Google and Amazon who run and maintain the servers. 

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/business) is perfect for cloud storage. Upload your files to Dropbox and then access them from anywhere. They get password-protected with advanced digital security, so no-one but you can access them.      

#### Go online to work on documents and projects
Use [Google Docs](https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en_in/products/docs/) for word processing. There’s no need to download documents and email them back and forth. You and your team create and edit documents in your web browser, and they’re stored on the cloud. All the changes you make are automatically saved as you edit. And there’s a chat option your team can use to discuss what they’re editing. 

Use [Basecamp ](https://basecamp.com/it-workshow-)to manage projects. Outline tasks, assign them to team members, and monitor progress. All from the Basecamp website.  

#### Find software to automate basic tasks
Use law practice management software like [Clio](https://www.clio.com/), [Jarvis Legal](http://www.jarvis-legal.com/), [Practice Panther](https://www.practicepanther.com/), and [Rocket Matter](https://www.rocketmatter.com/). They help you manage your clients, automate billing, edit documents, set appointments, track your work hours, and keep accounts. 

Use [Lawpay](https://lawpay.com/how-it-works/) to collect payments from clients. They pay using their credit card, via a computer or even with their smartphone. And you collect the payments in your office, through your website, or on the go. 

#### Use digital tools for office work
Use [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) to take notes digitally. It’s flexible enough for you to record ideas effectively without breaking your flow of thought.  

Use [Adobe Acrobat](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat.html?promoid=DMMD1FLC&mv=other) to create and edit PDFs. PDF (Portable Document Format) is a type of document (like Microsoft Word documents are a type of document) that’s used by most businesses. Adobe Acrobat is a powerful tool to create, edit, and review PDFs.

Use [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.in/) for e-signatures. It lets you and your clients scan signatures or fingerprints onto PDFs, or sign on a touchscreen. 

Use [eFax.com](http://efax.com/) to get faxes as emails, if you have clients who insist on faxing you.

#### Find an ediscovery platform to store, edit, review, and ‘produce’ documents  
Ediscovery (also ‘e-discovery’, and ‘edisclosure’) is the next big thing and it’s one of the big advantages of going paperless. Instead of ‘regular’ discovery with paper documents, ediscovery uses electronic information like Microsoft Word files, PDFs, and emails. It’s a much more useful approach.   

Use [GoldFynch](https://goldfynch.com/) to store, review, and edit your files and emails. The software runs off the internet, so there’s nothing to download. And it has a powerful search engine that helps you find information across all file types. So you can search Word documents, PDFs, and emails simultaneously. You can’t do that with regular apps.

### Go paperless. Your clients will thank you.  
And it just might help you land your next big case, so it’s worth the effort!
