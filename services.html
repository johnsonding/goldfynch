			<h2>
			    Choose which servers store your data
			</h2><hr>
			<p>
			    <em>GoldFynch.com</em>
			stores data on <a href="https://blog.goldfynch.com/2016/07/13/should-i-use-cloud-based-services-a-quick-guide/">cloud servers</a> based in North America, but <em>GoldFynch Services</em> gives you other options.
			</p>
			
			<h3>
			    Store data on your own server
			</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li><p>
			        <strong>We install GoldFynch on a local server on your office premises. </strong>
			        You use your own equipment – based on our specifications – or buy equipment directly from us (and we take care of warranties and maintenance).
			    </p></li>
			    <li><p>
			        <strong>You get complete control of content:</strong>
			        Files are stored on your own devices, move over your own networks, and are processed on your own server.
			    </p></li>
			    <li><p>
			        <strong>However, it’s the most complicated and expensive option</strong>
			        . You need to have a capable IT team, handle your own security and network administration, maintain your own equipment (if you haven’t bought it from
			        us), and handle data backup, software upgrades, etc.
			    </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			    <a href="./contact.html">Contact us for a detailed quote or an on-premises solution&gt;&gt; </a>
			</p>
			<p>
			    <strong>Price:</strong>
			    $20,000 and above, depending on the options you select.
			</p>
			
			<h3>
			    Store data on a private server
			</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li><p>
			        <strong>We run GoldFynch on a ‘leased’ server dedicated solely for you.</strong>
			        The server is still on a cloud farm hosted by a third party, but is exclusively yours. Data is encrypted and transmitted from your office to the server
			        for processing and storage.
			    </p></li>
			    <li><p>
			        <strong>You get all the advantages of cloud computing.</strong>
			        You don’t have to worry about server maintenance, upgrades, and backups; and you will also have access to the server from anywhere.
			    </p></li>
			    <li><p>
			        <strong>This costs less that the <em>on-premises</em> option</strong>
			        above, but more than the regular <em>GoldFynch.com</em> cloud option.
			    </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			    <a href="./contact.html">Contact us if you want a dedicated server&gt;&gt;</a>
			</p>
			
			<h3>
			    Store data on a server-cloud from your continent
			</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li><p>
			        <strong>We find you a cloud-provider on your continent. </strong>
			        The servers used to store your data will be subject to the laws of your region.
			    </p></li>
			    <li><p>
			        <strong>You get all the advantages of cloud computing</strong>
			        . You’ll automatically get our latest software updates and benefit from our proactive error handling. Plus, we handle maintenance. <strong></strong>
			    </p></li>
			    <li><p>
			        <strong>The prices will be far less than ‘on-premises’ option</strong>
			        , but higher than our North American <em>GoldFynch.com</em> prices (since cloud services outside USA tend to cost more). <strong></strong>
			    </p></li>
