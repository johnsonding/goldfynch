                <p>Secure access over HTTPS (SSL) is provided with all GoldFynch domains. Only certain members of the GoldFynch team have direct access to the live database and all access is logged. Our data-centers have passed the SSAE16 audit. For information about security on our Enterprise Plan please contact us.</a>

                <p>All GoldFynch accounts are password protected (pretty standard). We also provide an option to require complex passwords.

All user passwords are stored in the database only after being passed through a one-way hash-and-salt technique (a standard practice for high security).</p>

                <p>Each and every file, document, image, task, milestone, and byte of information you store with us is owned by you. We won't copy, share, or modify your data. We will never even access your data without your consent. If you ever delete your account, we will delete all your data from our servers after a period of 30 days.

You can download a full copy of your database once each day. Our "file backup tool" allows you to keep a copy of all files.</p>
