			<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

				Mazira, LLC, is the provider of the GoldFynch service (&ldquo;Mazira&rdquo;), takes the privacy of GoldFynch &nbsp;users
				seriously. We developed this privacy policy (&ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) to describe how personal information is collected,
				used, disclosed, and protected by Mazira when you visit or interact with the GoldFynch website(s) - <a href="http://www.goldfynch.com">www.goldfynch.com</a>				- and the GoldFynch products and services. This Policy does not apply to any other website, product, or service operated
				by Mazira, or to any of our offline activities. When we say &ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;Subscriber&rdquo; or &ldquo;Member,&rdquo;
				we&rsquo;re referring to the person or entity that&rsquo;s registered with us to use the Services.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>

				email address we have at the time of the change. Any changes will be effective as of the date we post them on the Website
				or send the email (whichever date is earlier). You may object to any changes within 20 days after they&rsquo;re posted
				on our Website or delivered to you, in which case none of the proposed changes will be effective with respect to information
				that we&rsquo;ve already collected from you, but will apply only to information we collect in the future. We won&rsquo;t

			<h1>6. YOUR INFORMATION</h1>
			<p>We gather information from you in various ways when you use the GoldFynch website(s) and services. The information collected
				is of two general types, namely personal information and aggregate data. As used in this Policy, the term &ldquo;personal
				information&rdquo; means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as name, e-mail address, telephone
				number, address, credit card number, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users), and demographic and other
				information when directly linked to information that can identify an individual.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h1><strong>7. Information You Provide to Us:</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
			<p>When you use the Services, consult with our customer service team, send us an email, or communicate with us in any way,
				you&rsquo;re giving us information that we collect. That information may include your and your Subscribers&rsquo; IP
				address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, credit card information, operating system, as well as details
				like gender, occupation, location, birth date, purchase history, and other demographic information. By giving us this
				information, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, transferred to the United States and stored
				by us, as described in our&nbsp;<a href="http://mailchimp.com/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p>The following are examples of the sort of information we may collect from you.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Registration information &mdash; When you register to use the GoldFynch service, we collect your name and email address,
					and other information used to authenticate your identity and connect your GoldFynch cases and account(s).</li>
			</ol>
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Upload/Attachment information &mdash; When you use GoldFynch to upload and manage documents, images and other electronic
					files, we collect, keep and some of the information about a file (e.g. filetype, size, filename, date).</li>

					make available, such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
					pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual
					users, to analyze trends, to administer the GoldFynch system, to track users&rsquo; movements around the site and to
					gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Ordinarily, this is non-personally-identifying information.
					To the extent such information contains or is linked to personally identifiable information, such information will be
					protected in accordance with this Policy.</li>
			</ol>
