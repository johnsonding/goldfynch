				<p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING &ldquo;ACCEPTED AND AGREED TO,&rdquo; CUSTOMER AGREES TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</strong></p>
				<p>These Terms of Service constitute an agreement (this &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agreement</span>&rdquo;) by and between Mazira, LLC, an Iowa limited liability company whose principal place of business is 316 E. Court St., Iowa City, IA 52240 (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provider</span>&rdquo;) and the individual, corporation, LLC, partnership, sole proprietorship, or other business or other entity executing this Agreement (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer</span>&rdquo;). This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks &ldquo;Accepted and Agreed To&rdquo; (the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effective Date</span>&rdquo;). Your access to and use of the System (defined below) is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with all of the terms of this Agreement, and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, our GoldFynch Privacy Policy) and procedures that may be published from time to time by Provider. These terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the System. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then you may not access or use any of Provider&rsquo;s services. &nbsp;If you are accessing or using the System on behalf of Customer or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of that entity and have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms &ldquo;Customer&rdquo; and &ldquo;You&rdquo; shall refer to such entity. Customer&rsquo;s use of and Provider&rsquo;s provision of Provider&rsquo;s System (as defined below in Section 1.6) are governed by this Agreement. You and Provider hereby agree as follows:</p>
				<p>EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTANDS IT, AND AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS, AND THAT THE PERSON SIGNING ON ITS BEHALF HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO DO SO. THE PERSON EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT ON CUSTOMER&rsquo;S BEHALF REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND CUSTOMER TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>
				<ol>
				<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Term &amp; Termination.</span></strong>
				<ol>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Term</span>. The term of this Agreement (the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Term</span>&rdquo;) shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for the subscription period set forth in the Order or, if none, for one (1) year. Thereafter, the Term will renew for successive periods equal to the original subscription period set forth in the Order, unless either party refuses such renewal by written notice 30 or more days before the renewal date.</li>
				<li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Termination for Cause</span></em>. Either party may terminate this Agreement for the other&rsquo;s breach, including Customer&rsquo;s or a User&rsquo;s violation of the AUP, by written notice, effective in 30 days unless the other party first cures such breach.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effects of Termination</span>. Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer shall cease all use of the System and delete, destroy, or return all copies of the Documentation in its possession or control. If an order or subscription period sets forth an expiration date and is not renewed, Customer may not be able to access the System after that date. The following provisions will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement: (a) any obligation of Customer to pay fees incurred before termination; (b) Articles and Sections 6 (<em>IP &amp; Feedback</em>), 7 (<em>Confidential Information</em>), 3 (<em>Warranty Disclaimers</em>), 9 (<em>Indemnification</em>), and 10 (<em>Limitation of Liability</em>); and (c) any other provision of this Agreement that must survive to fulfill its essential purpose.</li>

				</li>
				<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</span></strong><strong>.</strong>
				<ol>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dollar Cap</span>. PROVIDER&rsquo;S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED what you paid us for the Service the month before.</li>
				<li>.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exclusion of Consequential Damages</span>. IN NO EVENT WILL PROVIDER BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clarifications &amp; Disclaimers</span>. THE LIABILITIES LIMITED BY THIS ARTICLE 10 APPLY: (a) TO LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE; (b) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE; (c) EVEN IF PROVIDER IS ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DAMAGES IN QUESTION AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE; AND (d) EVEN IF CUSTOMER&rsquo;S REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this Article 10, Provider&rsquo;s liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible. For the avoidance of doubt, Provider&rsquo;s liability limits and other rights set forth in this Article 10 apply likewise to Provider&rsquo;s affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers, agents, sponsors, directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other repr</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demonstration or Beta System</span>.

No compensation will be paid to Customer for any use of the System or for performing any service or giving any advice or analysis to, or for the benefit of, Provider.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> INDEMNIFICATION</span></strong><strong>.</strong> Customer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Provider and the Provider Associates (as defined below) against any &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indemnified Claim</span>,&rdquo; meaning any third party claim, suit, or proceeding arising out of or related to Customer's alleged or actual use of, misuse of, or failure to use the System, including without limitation: (a) claims by Users or by Customer's employees, as well as by Customer&rsquo;s own customers; (b) claims related to unauthorized disclosure or exposure of personally identifiable information or other private information, including Customer Data; (c) claims related to infringement or violation of a copyright, trademark, trade secret, or privacy or confidentiality right by written material, images, logos or other content uploaded to the System through Customer&rsquo;s account, including without limitation by Customer Data; and (d) claims that use of the System through Customer&rsquo;s account harasses, defames, or defrauds a third party or violates the CAN-Spam Act of 2003 or any other law or restriction on electronic advertising. Indemnified Claims include, without limitation, claims arising out of or related to Provider&rsquo;s negligence. Customer&rsquo;s obligations set forth in this Article 9 include retention and payment of attorneys fees and payment of court costs, as well as settlement at Customer&rsquo;s expense and payment of judgments. Provider will have the right, not to be exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it admit wrongdoing or liability or subjects it to any ongoing affirmative obligations. (The &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provider Associates</span>&rdquo; are Provider&rsquo;s officers, directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, agents, successors, and assigns.)</li>
				<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> REPRESENTATIONS &amp; WARRANTIES</span></strong><strong>. </strong>
				<ol>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">From Provider</span>. Provider represents and warrants that it is the owner of the System and of each and every component thereof, or the recipient of a valid license thereto, and that it has and will maintain the full power and authority to grant the rights granted in this Agreement without the further consent of any third party. Provider&rsquo;s representations and warranties in the preceding sentence do not apply to use of the System in combination with hardware or software not provided by Provider, including uploaders, plug-ins and other third-party software which a User may use to interact with the System. Third party content and software used by You is at Customer&rsquo;s sole risk. In the event of a breach of the warranty in this Section 1, Provider, at its own expense, will promptly take the following actions: (a) secure for Customer the right to continue using the System; (b) replace or modify the System to make it noninfringing; or (c) terminate the infringing features of the Service and refund to Customer any prepaid fees for such features, in proportion to the portion of the Term left after such termination. In conjunction with Customer&rsquo;s right to terminate for breach where applicable, the preceding sentence states Provider&rsquo;s sole obligation and liability, and Customer&rsquo;s sole remedy, for breach of the warranty in this Section 8.1 and for potential or actual intellectual property infringement by the System.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">From Customer</span>. Customer represents and warrants that: (a) it has the full right and authority to enter into, execute, and perform its obligations under this Agreement and that no pending or threatened claim or litigation known to it would have a material adverse impact on its ability to perform as required by this Agreement; (b) it has accurately identified itself and it has not provided any inaccurate information about itself to or through the System; and (c) it is a corporation, the sole proprietorship of an individual 18 years or older, an individual 18 years or older, or another entity authorized to do business pursuant to applicable</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Warranty Disclaimers</span>. Except to the extent set forth in the SLA and in Section 1 above, CUSTOMER ACCEPTS THE SYSTEM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND AS AVAILABLE, WITH NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING FROM STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING: (a) PROVIDER HAS NO OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY OR DEFEND CUSTOMER OR USERS AGAINST CLAIMS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; (b) PROVIDER DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SYSTEM WILL PERFORM WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR ERROR; AND (c) PROVIDER DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SYSTEM IS SECURE FROM HACKING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED INTRUSION OR THAT CUSTOMER DATA WILL REMAIN PRIVATE OR SECURE.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</span></strong><strong>.</strong> &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confidential Information</span>&rdquo; refers to the following items either Provider or Customer discloses to the other: (a) any document a party marks &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo;; (b) the Documentation and software comprising the System, whether or not marked or designated confidential; and (d) any other nonpublic, sensitive information disclosed by Provider or Customer to the other, whether or not marked or designated &ldquo;Confidential.&rdquo; Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is in a party&rsquo;s possession at the time of disclosure; (ii) is independently developed by a party without use of or reference to Confidential Information; (iii) becomes known publicly, before or after disclosure, other than as a result of a party&rsquo;s improper action or inaction; or (iv) is approved for release in writing by the disclosing party.
				<ol>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nondisclosure</span><em>. </em>Provider and Customer shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than providing or using the System as their interests appear (the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span>&rdquo;). A receiving party: (a) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any employee or contractor of the receiving party unless such person needs access in order to facilitate the Purpose and executes a nondisclosure agreement with terms no less restrictive than those of this Article 7; and (b) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other third party without the disclosing party&rsquo;s prior written consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar nature and importance, but with no less than reasonable care. A receiving party shall promptly notify disclosing party of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information that comes to a receiving party&rsquo;s attention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. In such event, the receiving party shall give the disclosing party prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with the disclosing party in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at the disclosing party&rsquo;s expense.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Injunction</span>. Each party agrees that breach of this Article 7 would cause the disclosing party irreparable injury, for which monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation, and that in addition to any other remedy, disclosing party will be entitled to injunctive relief against such breach or threatened breach, without proving actual damage or posting a bond or other security.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Termination &amp; Return</span>. Upon termination of this Agreement, each party shall return all copies of Confidential Information to the disclosing party or confirm, in writing, the destruction thereof.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Retention of Rights</span>. This Agreement does not transfer ownership of Confidential Information or grant a license thereto.</li>

Customer recognizes that the System and its components are protected by copyright and other laws.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feedback</span>. Provider has not agreed to and does not agree to treat as confidential any Feedback (as defined below) Customer or Users provide to Provider, and nothing in this Agreement or in the parties&rsquo; dealings arising out of or related to this Agreement will restrict Provider&rsquo;s right to use, profit from, disclose, publish, keep secret, or otherwise exploit Feedback, without compensating or crediting Customer or the User in question. (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feedback</span>&rdquo; refers to any suggestion or idea for improving or otherwise modifying any of Provider&rsquo;s products or services.)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

In the event that it suspects any breach of the requirements of this Section 1, including without limitation by Users, Provider may suspend Customer&rsquo;s access to the System without advanced notice, in addition to such other remedies as Provider may have. Neither this Agreement nor the AUP requires that Provider take any action against Customer or any User or other third party for violating the AUP, this Section 5.1, or this Agreement, but Provider is free to take any such action it sees fit.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unauthorized Access</span>. Customer shall take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access to the System, including without limitation by protecting its passwords and other log-in information.

All Users of the System must be employees of Customer or independent contractors who are bound by contractual obligation to use the System solely in the course of Customer&rsquo;s business and strictly in accordance with this Agreement. All other uses of the System are strictly prohibited.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compatibility</span>. Customer understands that the System is compatible only with certain types of computers, operating systems, and filetypes or extensions, and that Customer is responsible for assuring the compatibility between its computer systems, filetypes, its software solutions, if any, and the System.</li>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Provider may disclose Customer Data as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. Provider shall give Customer prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with Customer in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at Customer&rsquo;s expense. Customer possesses and retains all right, title, and interest in and to Customer Data, and Provider&rsquo;s use and possession thereof is solely on Customer&rsquo;s behalf. Customer grants Provider and its affiliates and related entities, a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, display, modify, adapt, translate, archive, store, and create derivative works from such Customer Date, in any form, format, or medium, of any kind now known or later developed, in order to provide the services delivered through the System. Customer may access and copy any Customer Data in Provider&rsquo;s possession at any time, and Provider shall reasonably facilitate such access and copying promptly after Customer&rsquo;s request.</li>
				<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Handling, Retention, &amp; Deletion</span>. Provider shall observe Provider&rsquo;s Privacy Policy and all other of Provider&rsquo;s policies regarding retention and deletion of Customer Data in effect from time to time during the Term. Except as permitted in such policy(ies) or elsewhere in this Agreement, Provider shall not erase Customer Data, or any copy thereof, without Customer&rsquo;s prior written consent and shall follow any written instructions from Customer regarding retention and erasure of Customer Data.
