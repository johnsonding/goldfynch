				<div class="body">
					<p>GoldFynch is a cloud-based, e-discovery review platform provided as “software as a service”.</p>
					<p>
						GoldFynch functions much like other web-based software you use, like email: all you have to do is go to the website (goldfynch.com)
						and create an account for free. If you already have an account log in to start using it. Once you are logged in, just
						create a case. You can then drag and drop files (PDF, emails, Word docs etc) into GoldFynch. The files are automatically
						processed and made instantly searchable. It’s like having your own private search engine.

				<h5 class="title">What is E-discovery?</h5>
				<div class="body">
					<p>
						e-Discovery (or electronic discovery) is a broad term used to describe collecting documents in an electronic format (such
						as PDF, Microsoft Word etc.) and searching for information within the documents. It also includes the production or
						export of documents in an electronic format.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sometimes paper documents are scanned and the text is electronically extracted by OCR to make electronic documents. This
						is also e-discovery. The length and breadth of e-discovery is well described in this Wikipedia entry.

					<p>
						GoldFynch takes a less-is-more approach to e-Discovery.  If you want an e-Discovery solution that’s fast, cost-effective and easy to use, GoldFynch is the answer.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are a lot of e-Discovery solutions out there. Most started out with a focus on providing one specific feature and providing
						it really well. In many cases, somewhere over the course of time things got complicated. Tasks and features that were
						once simple became frustratingly tedious. The features that long-time users knew and loved become harder to use, while
						newly added features that aren’t necessary for everyone continue to drive costs.

				<h5 class="title"> Is E-Discovery only for lawyers & law firms?</h5>
				<div class="body">
                    <p>
                        The Short Answer: NO!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Long Answer: e-Discovery is a term from the legal industry that reflects the ever-increasing amount of
                        data involved in preparing for a case (potentially millions of documents in varying file types need to be reviewed for each case,
                        including emails, memos, bank accounts, spreadsheets, diagrams, etc). We’ve included some industry-specific features
                        for the legal field (such as a super-fast Bates Number search and upload alerts for missing Bates Numbers), but the majority
                        of GoldFynchs’ e-Discovery features are universal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reality is that everyone can benefit from e-Discovery. Whether you’re an academic,
                        business owner, student, or just overwhelmed by any collection of documents or datasets, GoldFynch offers e-Discovery, simplified.
