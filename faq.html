				<h2 class="text-center">GoldFynch FAQ</h2>
		        <h3>What is GoldFynch?</h3>
				<p>
					GoldFynch is a cloud-based, e-discovery review platform provided as “software as a service”. GoldFynch functions much like other web-based software you use, like email: all you have to do is go to the website (goldfynch.com) and create an account for free. If you already have an account log in to start using it.
Once you are logged in, just create a case. You can then drag and drop files (PDF, emails, Word docs etc) into GoldFynch. The files are automatically processed and made instantly searchable. It’s like having your own private search engine.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>Where is my data being uploaded?</h3>
				<p>
					Your data is being uploaded to a secure location in the cloud. Only you can access your own data. For both the drag and drop browser option and the dedicated uploader, your data is encrypted during transmission to our site.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>What is E-Discovery?</h3>
				<p>
					e-Discovery (or electronic discovery) is a broad term used to describe collecting documents in an electronic format (such as PDF, Microsoft Word etc.) and searching for information within the documents.  It also includes the production or export of documents in an electronic format.<br><br>

					Sometimes paper documents are scanned and the text is electronically extracted by OCR to make electronic documents. This is also e-discovery. The length and breadth of e-discovery is well described in this Wikipedia entry.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>What file formats do you support?</h3>
				<p>
					<b>At the moment we support the following formats. Check back often, this list is always growing based on our customers’ needs</b><br>
					<ul>
					<li>Microsoft Word ( .doc , .docx)</li>
					</ul>

				</p><br>
		        <h3>What software & hardware do I need?</h3>
				<p>
					An Internet connection and a browser on your laptop, desktop, phone, or tablet is all you need to use GoldFynch. We recommend Chrome, Firefox, or Safari browsers for the best experience. GoldFynch runs on the cloud and is software as service, so you don’t need any dedicated hardware or software.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>Is my data safe? What about security?</h3>
				<p><em>Just like your clients value the security and confidentiality you provide, we take security very seriously.</em></p>
				<p><strong>Your data is&nbsp;always&nbsp;safe with us.&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p>We use industry standard,&nbsp;state of the art encryption technology. Your data is encrypted during transmission to our cloud sites and stored behind firewalls&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<strong>the same security levels used in online banking.</strong></p><br>
		        <h3>Do I need a dedicated IT team or support?</h3>
				<p>
					Nope. If you have one, all the better, but since GoldFynch runs on the cloud, we take care of all the software and hardware requirements. If you use the Internet, you can use GoldFynch.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>Why should I choose GoldFynch?</h3>
				<p><strong>There are&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;of&nbsp;e-Discovery solutions out there.</strong>&nbsp;Most&nbsp;started out with a focus on providing one specific feature and providing it really well. In many cases, somewhere over the course of time things got complicated. Tasks and features that were once simple became frustratingly tedious.&nbsp;The features that long-time users knew and loved become harder to use, while newly added features that aren&rsquo;t necessary for everyone continue to drive costs.</p>
				<p><strong>GoldFynch&nbsp;takes a less-is-more approach to e-Discovery.&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p><strong>We&nbsp;designed&nbsp;and built it&nbsp;from scratch&nbsp;with constant feedback from actual lawyers and paralegals who use e-Discovery every day.&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li><em>The goal is simple</em>: e-Discovery software with 0 learning curve.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
				<li><em>The values on which we base every design decision:&nbsp;</em></li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
				<li>Speed. Accuracy. Simplicity. Transparency.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>If you want an e-Discovery solution that&rsquo;s&nbsp;fast, cost-effective&nbsp;and easy to use,&nbsp;GoldFynch is the answer.&nbsp;</strong></p>
				<p>An early-adopter of GoldFynch&nbsp;on&nbsp;why he made the switch:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><em>&ldquo;Your product is very different from other products and services&hellip;[GoldFynch is] a) Easy to use. b) Easy to access. c) Easy to upload. d) Easy to manage.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></li>
				</ul><br>
		        <h3>Do I need to organize a training session for my firm?</h3>
				<p>
					<b>We’ve designed GoldFynch so that training isn’t necessary.</b> Just log in and take it for a spin — our guided demo walks you through the features available and helps you get started.<br><br>
 
					<b>Most people take between 10 and 15 minutes to feel comfortable using GoldFynch.</b> If you have any questions about getting started, please drop us a line at <a href="mailto:support@goldfynch.co">support@goldfynch.co</a>.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>What is a case?</h3>
				<p>
					A case is the container for your data. You can create as many cases as you like. All searches, activity, tags etc., are based only on the data uploaded to a specific case. You can create different cases for each issue or dataset on which you are currently working.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>Is E-Discovery only for lawyers & law firms?</h3>
				<p>
					<b>The Short Answer: NO!</b><br><br>
 
					The Long Answer: e-Discovery is a term from the legal industry that reflects the ever-increasing amount of data involved in preparing for a case (potentially millions of documents in varying file types need to be reviewed for each case, including emails, memos, bank accounts, spreadsheets, diagrams, etc). <b>We’ve included some industry-specific features for the legal field</b> (such as a super-fast Bates Number search and upload alerts for missing Bates Numbers), <b>but the majority of GoldFynchs’ e-Discovery features are universal.</b><br><br>
 
					The reality is that everyone can benefit from e-Discovery. <b>Whether you’re an academic, business owner, student, or just overwhelmed by any collection of documents or datasets, GoldFynch offers e-Discovery, simplified.</b>
				</p><br>
		        <h3>What happens when I delete a case?</h3>
				<p>
					All the data within the case is completely erased from our system. We do not back up deleted cases. We have safeguards in place to ensure you don’t accidentally delete a case.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>Why the name GoldFynch?</h3>
				<p>
					The goldfinch is the state bird of Iowa, and shares a similar name with a certain literary hero from the south.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>What is Mazira & how is it related to GoldFynch?</h3>
				<p>
					Mazira LLC, is the award-winning development team behind GoldFynch.
				</p><br>
		        <h3>How does your billing work?</h3>
				<p>
					You are billed for the cases in your account. The free case has no charge and has a 1GB limit. Premium cases are  Egg(3GB, $15/month), Nestling(15 GB, $50/month), Fledgling (50 GB , $250/month). Premium cases are pro rated per second and billed monthly, until the monthly maximum. For example, if you have a Fledgling case running for 1 day and you delete it, at the end of the month, you will only be billed approximately $8.33.
				</p><br>
			        <h3>How do I pay? What forms of payment do you accept?</h3>
					<p>
						Payment is through credit card. You can pay very easily after you log into your GoldFynch account by clicking the “Billing” button. We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.
